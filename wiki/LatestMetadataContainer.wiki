#summary This wiki page is scraped by the Icefilms addon to get the latest metadata container.
#labels metadata,container,icefilms

Metadata container is the .zip that contains all the default metadata for the addon. It is automatically handled by addon, you do not need to manually download it. 

To update the container, paste the new megaupload link to the .zip under Link, increase the Releasenumber by exactly 1 digit, and set the date to your current date. Don't make mistakes or you will break the plugin's scraper.
