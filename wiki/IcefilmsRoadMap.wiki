= v1.1.0 =
Planned features, maybe a bit ambitious. Progress noted in brackets.
 * good tidy up of the code
 * Youtube trailer support - links to Youtube add-on (done)
 * TVShow, Seasons and Episode metadata support. + tv meta in metadata container.
 * Displaying backdrops support, + backdrops contained in metadata container.
 * Lightweight http server to serve files as a url as they are being downloaded by python (would enable pause and full video caching)
 
== To Do for Future Releases ==
 * megavid support
 * special handling for multi part files (queues parts, treats multi-part files as a video playlist)
 * 2shared

* NOTE:* I had previously thought that [http://trac.xbmc.org/ticket/10779 this patch] would provide a universal xbmc streaming cache. 
This is not the case. I have since been told that video cache implementation in python _is_ possible through use of a http server.
