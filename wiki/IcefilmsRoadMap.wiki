 * Movie Metadata support (done)
 * Pre-Packaged metadata container support
 * a download limit notifier. addon will notify you if you've exceeded your megaup down limit (done)
 * better search (done)
 * download videofiles to folder of your choice. add to library. (done)
 * favourites (done)
 * some new images for sub-categories that htpc guy is preparing (done)
 * proper directories for tv show seasons (done)


== To Do for Future Releases ==
 * TVShow, Seasons and Episode metadata support
 * Lightweight http server to serve files as a url as they are being downloaded by python (would enable pause and full video caching)
 * megavid support
 * special handling for multi part files (queues parts, treats multi-part files as a video playlist)
 * 2shared

* NOTE:* I had previously thought that [http://trac.xbmc.org/ticket/10779 this patch] would provide a universal xbmc streaming cache. 
This is not the case. I have since been told that video cache implementation in python _is_ possible through use of a http server.
