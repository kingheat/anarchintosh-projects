#summary The LatestMetadataContainer wiki page is scraped by the Icefilms addon to get the latest metadata container.

Metadata containers are the .zip files that contains all the default metadata for the addon. It is automatically handled by addon, you do not need to manually download it. 

Base container is small and focuses on being lightweight. Additional container is bigger and contains additional things like backdrops etc

To update the containers, paste the new megaupload link to the .zip under Link, increase the Releasenumber by exactly 1 digit, and set the date to your current date. Don't make mistakes or you will break the plugin's scraper.
